# Sammath Naur: Verified Internet Protocol Specifications

Mathematical formalization of Internet RFCs in Coq. Complete type definitions, state machines, and theorem statements. Proofs admitted for systematic completion.

## Scope

**Ashnazg** - TLS 1.3, X.509, Certificate Transparency, ACME  
**Narya** - BGP-4, BGPsec, RPKI, OSPF  
**Nenya** - DNS, DNSSEC, DNS-over-HTTPS  
**Vilya** - TCP, UDP, QUIC, IPv4, IPv6

## Purpose

RFCs specify protocols in natural language. Natural language admits multiple interpretations. Implementation divergence creates vulnerabilities. Mathematical specifications eliminate ambiguity. Protocol semantics become provable facts rather than negotiated agreements.

## Effect

Transfers semantic authority from standards bodies to mathematics. First comprehensive formalization becomes canonical reference through coordination economics. Mathematical specifications cannot be amended through institutional consensus.

Verified specifications provide axioms for AI reasoning about network infrastructure. AI systems generate provably correct implementations, detect specification violations mathematically, and operate network infrastructure with deductive guarantees rather than probabilistic inference.

## Technical

Coq 8.17.1. Dependent types. Extraction to OCaml/Haskell.
